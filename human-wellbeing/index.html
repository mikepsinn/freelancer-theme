    <h1>The End of the Health Explosion</h1>
    <p>
        The Thalidomide disaster occurred in the 50's producing many flipper babies and scaring the hell out of
        everyone.

    <p>
        Prior to this, putting drugs on the market required a few years of safety testing on animals. Then they were
        made available and efficacy trials were basically crowd-sourced for free. Case studies from patients were
        compiled and published by the American Medical Association etc. Often unanticipated benefits of drugs are
        unknown until people started using them.
    </p>
    <h3>FDA Safety Restrictions Dramatically Expanded in 1962</h3>
    <p>
        Following the Thalidomide disaster, the FDA began requiring 3 phases of clinical trials that spanned many years
        to slow down the availability and make sure they caught any major side effects (like flippers) before the
        drugs were approved.
    </p>
    <h4>Kefauver–Harris Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</h4>
    <p>
        The amendments granted the FDA the power to demand proof of efficacy before approving a drug.
        These powers were also tied to the orderly sequence of phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 trials now comprising
        the standard pharmaceutical life cycle.
    </p>
    <h4>Delayed Life-Saving Treatments</h4>
    <p>
        One unanticipated consequence of the amendments was that the new burden
        of proof made the process of drug development both more expensive and much longer, leading to
        increasing drug prices and a “drug lag”.
        After that point, whenever they released some new cancer or heart medication that was going to save 50
        thousand lives a year, it meant that over the previous 10 years of trials 500 people died because they didn't
        have
        access to the drug earlier.
    </p>
    <h4>Fewer Life-Saving Treatments</h4>
    <p>
        Another unanticipated consequence of the amendments was that the new burden
        of proof made drug development much more expensive and riskier for investors. This lead to
        and increase drug prices.
    </p>
    <h4>Increase in Patent Monopoly</h4>
    <p>
        Industry agitation surrounding the “drug lag” finally led to modification of the drug patenting
        system in the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. This further extended of drug
        patents.
        Thus Kefauver's amendments ultimately affected both pharmaceutical pricing and patenting —
        in a manner diametrically opposed to the one he intended.
    </p>
    <h4>Decreased Ability to Determine Comparative Efficacy</h4>
    <p>
        Another unintended consequence of the amendments was that the new structures of proof changed not only the
        behavior of the pharmaceutical industry, but also the conceptual categories used by biomedical researchers
        around the world. Pharmaceutical research came to be overwhelmingly organized around the placebo-controlled,
        randomized controlled trial. Although this system has greatly helped researchers gauge the efficacy of an
        individual drug, it has also rendered data on comparative efficacy much more difficult — and much more expensive
        — to find or produce.
    </p>
    <h4>Recent Efforts at Comparing Efficacy</h4>
    <p>
        Only in the past decade, through the action of the Reforming States Group, the Drug
        Effectiveness Research Program, and most recently funding of comparative effectiveness research through the
        American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Affordable Care Act, and now the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
        Institute, have we begun to catch up on the vital project of comparing therapeutics so that American consumers
        and their physicians can make meaningful treatment decisions — the project that motivated Kefauver's original
        investigations a half-century ago.
    </p>
    <h3>Growth In Lifespan Was Cut in Half</h3>
    <p>
        As a result of the slowed pace of the development of new life-saving treatments, the annual increase in
        human
        lifespan was cut in half from it's previous 4 year increase down to 2 years per decade.

    <h3>FDA Mandate is Not to Maximize Lives Saved</h3>
    <p>
        Increasing lifespan is not the congressional mandate of the FDA. Its mandate is to ensure the "safety and
        efficacy of drugs and medical devices".
        It has been very successful at fulfilling its mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
        However,
        if you reduce the speed limit to 1 mile per hour, it will be much safer for everyone and you could reduce
        traffic fatalities by 40k per year.
        However, there is an economic and societal cost to only moving 1 mph that would likely exceed the safety
        benefit. Likewise, if you dramatically slow the development of life-saving treatments, you will avoid the
        risk
        of flipper babies. But lots of people with AIDS and cancer will die while waiting for treatment.
    </p>
    <h3>Cognitive Bias Against Acts of Commission</h3>
    <p>
        Humans have a cognitive bias towards weighting harmful acts of commission to be worse than acts of omission
        even
        if the act of omission causes greater harm. It's seen in the trolley problem where people generally aren't
        willing to push a fat man in front of a train to save a family even though more lives would be saved.
    </p>
    <h3>High Cost of Development Favors Monopoly and Punishes Innovation</h3>
    <p>
        There's another problem with increasing costs of treatment development. In the past, a genius scientist
        could
        come up with a treatment, raise a few million dollars and do safety testing. Now that it costs a billion
        dollars
        to get a drug to market, the scientist has to persuade one of a few giant drug companies that can afford it
        to
        buy his patent. Then the drug company has 2 options:
    </p>
    <h4>Option 1: Risk $1 billion on clinical trials</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Possibility A:</b> Drug turns out to be one of the 90% the FDA rejects. GIVE BANKER A BILLION DOLLARS. DO NOT
                              PASS GO.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Possibility B:</b> Drug turns out to be one of the 10%, the FDA approves. Yay!!! Now it's time to try to
                              recover that
                              billion dollars.
                              However, there are very few drug companies with enough money to survive this game.
                              So, this company almost certainly
                              already has an existing crappier drug on the market to treat the same condition.
                              Hence, any profit they make from
                              this drug will likely be subtracting from revenue from other drugs they've already spent a
                              billion dollars on.
    </p>

    <h4>Option 2: Put the patent on the shelf</h4>
    <p>
        Do not take a 90% chance of wasting a billion dollars on failed trials.
        Do not risk making your already approved cash-cow drugs obsolete.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's the benefit of bringing better treatment to market if you're just going to lose a billion dollars?
        Either way, the profit incentive is entirely in favor of just buying better treatments and shelving them.
    </p>
    <h3>Cures Are Far Less Profitable Than Lifetime Treatments</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine you had to pay a lifetime of power bills all at once
        And
        that's just if the new drug is a lifelong treatment. If the new treatment is a permanent cure for the
        disease,
        replacing a lifetime of refills with a one time purchase would be economically disastrous. How is there any
        financial incentive for medical progress at all?
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, we don't have a complete monopoly on treatment development. However, the more expensive it is,
        the fewer participants
        can afford to be in that business. So it inevitably becomes more monopolistic and there arise more of these
        situations where the cost of trials exceeds the profits from selling the drug.
    </p>
    <h4>People With Rare Disease are Particularly Screwed</h4>
    <p>
        In the case of rare diseases, increasing the cost of treatment development to over a billion makes it
        impossible
        to recover your investment from a small number of patients. So rare disease patients are
        suffer the greatest harm from the added regulatory burden on development.
    </p>
    <h4>People With Rare Disease are Particularly Screwed</h4>
    <p>
        How high should the cost of drug development be on our list of human problems?
        Well, when something costs more, you get less of it. For people who are dying of cancer,
        the fact that we couldn't afford enough research to cure them is definitely
        at the top of their list of human problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Correlation is Not Causation</h2>
    <p>
        You might say "I don't know how much the FDA contributes to or hampers public health. I do know that
        correlation
        does not necessarily imply causation."
        However, a correlation plus a logical mechanism of action is the least bad method we have for inferring the
        most
        likely
        significant causal factor for an outcome (i.e. life expectancy). Assuming most likely causality based on
        temporal correlation is the entire basis of a clinical research study and the scientific method generally.
    </p>
    <h2>Diminishing Returns?</h2>
    <p>
        You might say "It seems more likely -- or as likely -- to me that drug development provides diminishing
        returns
        to life expectancy."
        However, diminishing returns produce a slope of exponential decay.
        It may be partially responsible, but it's not going to produce a sudden change in the linear slope of a
        curve
        a linear as life expectancy was before and after the FDA.
    </p>
    <img src="law_of_diminishing_returns.gif">
    <p>
        Additionally, we're only 3 lifetimes from George Washington. The modern scientific method has only been
        systematically applied to medicine for like .0001% of human history.
        However, the more clinical research studies I read, the more I realize we don't know.
        We know basically nothing at this point compared to what will eventually be known about the human body.
        And the currently highly
        restrictive overly cautious method of clinical research prevents us from knowing more faster.
        We're at the very beginning of thousands or millions of years of
        systematic discovery. So it's unlikely that this decline in lifespan growth is the result of diminishing
        returns due to our running out
        of things to discover.
    </p>
    <h2>Growth in Average Lifespan Has Now Completely Stopped</h2>
    <p>
        The strongest contributing factor for this has been the explosion in cost of treatment development.
        The biggest driver of this phenomenal increase has been the regulatory process governing Phase III clinical
        trials of new pharmaceuticals on human volunteers. One reason: Phase III clinical trials have become far
        larger and more complex than they were in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        From 1999 to 2005, the average
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            length of a clinical trial increased 70%
        </li>
        <li>
            number of routine procedures per trial increased 65%
        </li>
        <li>
            clinical trial staff work burden increased 67%
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        On top of that, increasingly stringent enrollment criteria and trial protocols resulted in
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            21 percent fewer volunteers being admitted into trials
        </li>
        <li>
            30 percent more enrollees dropping out before completion of the tests.
        </li>
    </ul>
